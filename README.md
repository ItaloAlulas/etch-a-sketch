This Etch-a-Sketch is one of the first interactive projects I built while learning web development.
It was inspired by the classic drawing toy and developed from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This project helped me solidify my understanding of DOM manipulation, event handling, dynamic grid creation, and visual interaction on the web.
